    "A dictionary is a mapping between a set of keys and values. The keys() method of a dictionary returns a keys-view object that exposes the keys. A little-known feature of keys views is that they also support common set operations such as unions, intersections, and differences. Thus, if you need to perform common set operations with dictionary keys, you can often just use the keys-view objects directly without first converting them into a set.\n",

    "The items() method of a dictionary returns an items-view object consisting of (key, value) pairs. This object supports similar set operations and can be used to perform operations such as finding out which key-value pairs two dictionaries have in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although similar, the values() method of a dictionary does not support the set operations described in this recipe. In part, this is due to the fact that unlike keys, the items contained in a values view arenâ€™t guaranteed to be unique. This alone makes certain set operations of questionable utility. However, if you must perform such calculations, they can be accomplished by simply converting the values to a set first."
